I'm proud to announce, that [chemical MIME] was [accepted] by the Debian
FTP-masters and it is now part of the Debian distribution as package
[`chemical-mime-data`][chemical-mime-data]. However the [GNOME chemistry
utils][gchemutils] are not yet accepted, but they are awaiting the review by
the FTP-masters in the [NEW] queue. The next packages will be [gchempaint]
(probably 0.6.7) and [bkchem] (probably 0.11.5).

The Debian packaging files of these packages are officially maintained by the
[debichem] project members (I belong to this group too) and they can be
found in our [SVN][^SVN] repository. I have to say "Many thanks!" to Michael
Banck, my sponsor, and "Join us!" to all who want to help packaging.

I've updated the Debian [Wiki] to fit the new situation. Search there, if you
want to know which packages await an review to suggest them for Debian
officially.

Stay tuned.
