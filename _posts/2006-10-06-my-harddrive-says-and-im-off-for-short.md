Just a short note: One of my harddrives is going to die (only 16 months after
purchase) and unfortunately it's the one with my beloved [Debian] installation.
All data is saved and I'm now going to send my drive (for those who want to
know it: it's a [Samsung SP1614N]) back to the manufacturer. So for the moment
I'm unable to do package maintenance (but I hope Michael will do it if
necessary), but I hope to be back very soon.
