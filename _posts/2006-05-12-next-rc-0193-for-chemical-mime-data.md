Because of issues and changes inside the [sourceforge.net] CVS[^CVS]
infrastructure it will need a few more days before I can release the next
RC[^RC] for [chemical-mime-data], which will be version `0.1.93`. There are
still a few steps to go for release `0.2.0`, but we are on the way.

[^CVS]: Concurrent Versions System
[^RC]: Release Candidate
