Today I released the first official version of
[`chemical-mime-data`][chemicalmime] after moving [back] to [sourceforge.net]
This release is thought to be the first RC[^RC] for the upcoming 0.2.0 version.
I made massive changes since our last release of [chemicalMIME 2]. One
important improvement is IMHO the database. It is now the place to drop all
informations. Have a look at the release notes to get an overview what has
changed.
