## Issue

I noticed, that my evolution was always directly scrolling to the end of a mail
in the mail view. That was really annoying.

## Solution

This is the &#8220;Cursor mode&#8221;. Just pressing <kbd>F7</kbd> disables it
and the mails are shown from the beginning. Thanks to [Lutz Frommberger]
